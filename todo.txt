Pathfinder magic item automatic roller
To do:

* Refactor code into GrimoireCore and resouce JSON objects

* Reformat all the .js data files into JSON resources

* Add roll weights for
 = CRB
  - Rings
 = APG
  - Rings

* I'm getting a problem where the random number generator is reliably getting the SAME item from a weighted list and I'm not sure why.
 = This is occuring for getHumanoid, getOutsider, getDeity, and several other lowest level methods
   when called from higher order functions like getIntelligence or getWeapon
